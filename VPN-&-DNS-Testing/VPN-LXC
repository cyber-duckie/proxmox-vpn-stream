# Test Public IP from inside the VPN LXC:

curl icanhazip.com
# Should show your VPN IP here

# Test DNS resolution:
cat /etc/resolv.conf
# It should show you your VPN's DNS server (in my case: 10.2.0.1)

# Verify traffic is routed though the VPN
traceroute 8.8.8.8
# The first hop should be the VPN, not your host’s default gateway.
